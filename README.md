### üëã Hey there friend!!! I'm **David**. I am a Senior Software Engineer at Bestow. I have a strong passion for distributed systems, microservices, secure data processing systems, Go, Python, and rare single-origin coffees. When time allows you can find me tinkering with one of my split mechanical keyboards. 

### üí™ I‚Äôm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Bestow [(check us out)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/insurtech-bestow-lands-120m-series-d-from-goldman-sachs-smith-point-capital/). Previously, I was a software engineer at Atlassian on the Jira Align and Bitbucket Cloud teams.

### üì∞ Note: I previously went by DataDavd/datadavd online (a relic from my data engineering days), but now use codeaucafe as my GitHub username.

### :mount_fuji: I'm located in the greater Seattle area.

### üíª Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. I like doing LeetCode, improving my knowledge of various software system designs, reading software-related books, and improving my Go knowledge.

### üìö Outside of software engineering and tech, I'm learning French, snowboard with my brother and friends, and love traveling with my wife.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Mechanical Keyboards
- daily driver: Boardsource lulu ergonomic mechanical keyboard with Alpaca V2 linear switches lubed with 205g0 and official Star Wars Galactic Empire DSA keycaps from [NovelKeys](https://novelkeys.com/products/star-wars-galactic-empire-dsa-keycap-set). What does it look like? [Find out](https://imgur.com/a/daily-driver-lulu-uxowLYo)! Check out my [QMK Layout](https://github.com/codeaucafe/qmk_firmware/blob/ddansby/lulu-keymap/keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/datadavd/keymap.c) too!
- debug keyboard: I use a [Rama Dual Shot M6-C](https://imgur.com/a/debug-keyboard-bUQWYTZ) macro keyboard with the keys mapped specifically to my custom shortcuts for easy debugging. The keyboard uses Rama artisan aluminum keycaps. Also, I use Zealio V2 65G tactile switches lubed with 205g0 with Deskeys V2 switch films.
- travel keyboard: [Lily58](https://imgur.com/a/WlNtPUB) (which is what the Lulu is based upon) with the same keymap.
