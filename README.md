### üëã Hey there friend!!! My name is **David Dansby**. I am a self-taught software engineer at Atlassian. I have a strong passion for distributed systems, microservices, secure data processing systems, Go, Python, and rare single-origin coffees. When time allows you can find me tinkering with one of my split mechanical keyboards. Recently, I've been getting into home automation. 

### üì∞ FYI: you may have previously seen me referred to as DataDavd or datadavd online which is relic username from my past data engineering days, but I now go by my codeaucafe username on GitHub. 

### üí™ I‚Äôm currently working remotely at Atlassian as a Software Engineer on our Jira Align product (mostly working on the C#/.NET backend sprinkled with some frontend work in React). Previously, I worked on the Bitbucket Cloud Data Privacy and Security team as a software engineer using Go and Python with a focus on all things security and data protection. And before that, I was a data engineer on the Data Analytics and Engineering team at Atlassian that owned the core data pipelines (we typically ingested 500GB+ of data each day into our pipelines; and processed even more!!!). 

### :mount_fuji: I'm located in the greater Seattle area.

### üíª Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. I like doing LeetCode, improving my knowledge of various software system designs, reading software-related books, and improving my Go knowledge.

### üìö Outside of software engineering and tech, I'm learning French, snowboard with my brother and friends, and love traveling with my wife.
