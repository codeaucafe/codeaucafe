### üëã Hey there friend!!! My name is **David Dansby**. I am a software engineer at Bestow. I have a strong passion for distributed systems, microservices, secure data processing systems, Go, Python, and rare single-origin coffees. When time allows you can find me tinkering with one of my split mechanical keyboards. Recently, I've been getting into home automation. 

### üí™ I‚Äôm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Bestow [(check us out)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/insurtech-bestow-lands-120m-series-d-from-goldman-sachs-smith-point-capital/). Previously, I was a software engineer at Atlassian on the Jira Align and Bitbucket Cloud teams.

### üì∞ Note: I previously went by DataDavd/datadavd online (a relic from my data engineering days), but now use codeaucafe as my GitHub username.

### :mount_fuji: I'm located in the greater Seattle area.

### üíª Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. I like doing LeetCode, improving my knowledge of various software system designs, reading software-related books, and improving my Go knowledge.

### üìö Outside of software engineering and tech, I'm learning French, snowboard with my brother and friends, and love traveling with my wife.
